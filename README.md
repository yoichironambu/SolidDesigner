# SolidDesigner 

#  [English](README.md) | [日本語](README.ja.md) | [Français](README.fr.md) | [Deutsch](README.de.md) | [Español](README.es.md)

**An open‑source platform for parametric CAD, high‑fidelity CAE, and topology optimization — with simulation‑driven design and AI assistance.**

> Goal: a professional‑grade system comparable to Creo Parametric that supports solid/surface modeling, assembly, drafting, structural mechanics, CFD, multiphysics, and optimization — where simulations can drive the design itself.

## Vision & Scope

SolidDesigner aims to be a **full‑stack, engineering‑grade** CAD/CAE platform:

- **Parametric CAD**: robust part/assembly modeling, sketches/constraints, history‑based features, and drafting.
- **CAE**: built‑in solvers and/or adapters for **structural mechanics (FEA)**, **fluid dynamics (CFD)**, **multiphysics**.
- **Optimization**: **topology/shape/size** optimization; reinforcement/weight reduction; simulation‑driven design loops.
- **AI Assistance**: an engineering “copilot” for constraint inference, feature intent detection, design space exploration, and solver configuration suggestions.
- **Extensibility**: modular architecture with a stable plugin and scripting API.

> **Status**: Active development (pre‑alpha). APIs and file formats may change.

---

## What’s in the Box

- A modern C++17/20 codebase with a **foundation submodule (“Alice”)**.
- A **desktop application** (“SolidDesigner”) built on the foundation.
- A clean separation between **Core/Data/Interaction/UI** layers.
- Early implementations of the **feature graph**, **parametric constraints**, **diagnostics/logging**, and **plugin hosting**.
- A long‑term plan for **CAE solvers** (FEA/CFD) and **optimization**.

### Layered Architecture (high‑level)

- **Alice/Core** — platform primitives, base utilities (memory, threading, diagnostics, math, units, geometry abstractions).
- **Alice/Data** — parametric model, feature/operation graph, constraint & dimension system, document/session services.
- **Alice/Interaction** — selection/picking, manipulators, command pipeline, undo/redo transactions, interaction graph.
- **Alice/UI** — Qt‑based (planned) shell, dockable panes, property browser, ribbon/menus/shortcuts.
- **SolidDesigner/APP** — the product layer: application lifecycle, persistence, project/workspace, plugins, scripting.
- **SolidDesigner/DATA/Interaction/UI** — product‑specific extensions over Alice layers.

> The **Alice** submodule is intentionally reusable and engine‑like; **SolidDesigner** composes it into a complete product.

## Core Concepts

- **Feature Graph**: All modeling operations (Sketch, Extrude, Revolve, Fillet, Pattern, Boolean, etc.) are nodes in a directed acyclic graph with **history & dependencies**. Rebuilds propagate deterministically.
- **Constraint System**: Geometric and dimensional constraints with solver back‑ends (sketch constraints today; 3D constraints planned).
- **Parametric Design**: Named parameters (dims, materials, BCs) can drive both geometry and analysis; supports expressions and units.
- **Simulation‑Driven Design**: Analyses evaluate candidate designs; results feed back to parameters (e.g., automate weight reduction to meet stress targets).
- **Multi‑representation Geometry**: Solid/surface/B‑Rep abstractions with tolerances; mesh generation for analysis; CAD↔CAE consistency.
- **Transactions**: Every command runs inside a transaction; full undo/redo; meaningful error messages via diagnostics engine.

---

install/bin/SolidDesigner.exe

# Linux
./install/bin/SolidDesigner
```

## Dependencies

This project is **modular**: most third‑party libraries are optional or pluggable.

- **Geometry**: OpenCascade (default); abstractions allow future kernels
- **Math**: Eigen
- **I/O**: fmt
- **Logging**: spdlog (backend), unified diagnostics facade in “Alice”
- **UI**: Qt 6 (widgets/QtQuick — TBD)
- **Meshing**: OCCT mesher, Gmsh, TetGen (adapters planned)
- **Solvers**: in‑house FEA/CFD; adapters to external solvers (future)
- **Visualization**: OCCT/VTK (planned)

Use `-DSD_WITH_<LIB>=ON/OFF` CMake options (see `CMakeLists.txt`) to toggle modules.

## Getting Started

A typical workflow target (end state):

1. **Create a project** and set default units/tolerances.
2. **Sketch** on a plane; use constraints/dimensions.
3. Create features: **Extrude**, **Revolve**, **Fillet**, **Shell**, **Pattern**…
4. **Assemble** parts; add mates/constraints.
5. **Mesh** the model (global + local controls).
6. Define **materials** and **boundary conditions**.
7. Run **FEA/CFD**; inspect stress/strain, modes, flow fields.
8. **Drive parameters** from results (e.g., reduce thickness until stress ≤ target).
9. Save as a **project** and export **STEP/IGES** or mesh files.

---

## Plugin & Scripting

- **Plugin ABI**: clean C++ interfaces for geometry ops, meshing, solvers, importers/exporters, and UI add‑ins.
- **Isolation**: stable ownership model and cross‑DLL safety (foundation provides Owning/Weak/Guard pointer utilities).
- **Scripting (planned)**: Python API to automate modeling, set up studies, post‑process results, and orchestrate design loops.
- **AI hooks (planned)**: register custom design advisors and ML models for intent prediction and optimization.

---

## Data & File Formats

### Native project format (in progress)

The native format is intended to be:

- **Structured**: metadata + typed payloads (geometry, mesh, results, thumbnails, etc.)
- **Versioned**: schema versioning with explicit upgrade pipeline
- **Incremental-friendly**: designed for partial reload and future cloud/workspace workflows
- **Stable-identity aware**: object IDs survive save/load, copy/paste, and upgrades

> The public wiki will host the canonical specification once the format stabilizes.

### Interoperability (planned / incremental)

- **CAD Interop**: STEP/IGES import/export (others via adapters)
- **Mesh/Results**: standard mesh/results formats for external solvers/post (VTK, MED, etc., planned)
- **Units**: consistent unit system with explicit metadata; dimensioned parameters in expressions

---

## Diagnostics, Logging & QA

- Unified **DiagnosticsEngine** with severity levels, source locations, and pluggable sinks (console, file, UI panel).
- Optional **spdlog** backend for fast, thread‑aware logging.
- **Assertions** and **defensive checks** across DLL boundaries.
- **Testing** via CTest; fixtures for geometry, meshing, solver correctness; reproducible cases attached to JIRA.

## FAQ

**How close is this to production tools like Creo?**  
The aspiration is parity for core workflows with a modern, open architecture. Today the project is pre‑alpha; many capabilities are WIP.

**Is there a scripting API?**  
A Python API is planned. Early internal scaffolding exists; public API is forthcoming.

**Which solver stack is used?**  
Early in‑house solvers are being prototyped. Adapters to external solvers (e.g., meshers/post) are planned.

**Will AI features require internet access?**  
No. The intent is to support offline inference with local models, with optional cloud integrations.

**Where can I track progress?**  
JIRA (roadmap/backlog) and the public GitHub wiki. Detailed design docs are in Confluence (access required).
